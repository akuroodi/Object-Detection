# Object-Detection

Contains a few different Python programs to detect objects in both images and video files using the YOLOv3 object detector

Based off of the following tutorial: https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/yolo-object-detection-with-opencv-and-pytorch-in-python

Modifications/Extensions:
- Sequentially performs detection on all images in a user-specified /images folder in the project directory
- Comments explaining YOLOv3 architecture in more detail (convolutional layers, outptut layers, non-maxima supression, etc.)
- Places all labeled images into a separate DetectedImages folder in the project directory
